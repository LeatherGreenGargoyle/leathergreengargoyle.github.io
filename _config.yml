resume_header_intro: "<p>I build software, yes, but more truly, I am building a new limb for the user: it must be as empowering as a fist, as second-nature as blinking, as robust as the human heart, capable of beating for a lifespan. But above all, it must reach out into the world, to retrieve new sensations and possibilities.</p><p>I love this work, both for the creative choice at the highest levels of design, as well as for the mechanics of its minutiae. I recognize the need for software to tell the user a seamless and riveting story; I also relish the challenge of the everyday bug and algorithm, and find the process as calming as folding fresh laundry, or sorting a cluttered workspace.</p><p>I love the scavenging of clues across documentation. I love the knitting of API route to controller to utility function, the tracing of data from server to component, and cleaning up its accidental spillage.</p><p>And I recognize that life is short, and that there is still so much work to be done</p>"
