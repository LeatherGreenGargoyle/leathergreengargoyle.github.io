resume_header_intro: "<p>In my first job as an online pop culture writer, my editor wanted us to understand one thing: 'With regards to the internet... We live in the Wild West right now. We can do anything we want.' I didn't understand him then, but today as a software engineer, no other thought guides my hand so fully.Today I am most inspired by applications and technologies which make possible novel, more fulfilling lifestyles and modes of thought. While conceptualizing and building my software, I like to imagine that I'm building a new limb for the user: it must be empowering as a fist, as second-nature as blinking, and as robust as the human heart, capable of beating for a lifespan.</p>"
