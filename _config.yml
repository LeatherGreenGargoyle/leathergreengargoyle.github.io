resume_header_intro: "<p>As a Javascript engineer, I build software, yes, but more truly, I am building a new limb for the user: it must be as empowering as a fist, as second-nature as breathing, as robust as the human heart, capable of beating for a lifespan. But above all, it must reach out into the world, to retrieve new sensations and possibilities.</p><p>This is the work I love, both for the creative choice at the highest levels of design, as well as for the mechanics of its minutiae. The wholeness of my being is engaged; I am, simultaneously, a storyteller spinning seamless user-experience, and a technician weaving together promises and callbacks. In this work my mind finds pasture to graze and strive within, joyfully.</p><p>The scavenging of clues across documentation. The knitting of API route to controller to utility function. The tracing of data from server to component, and the cleaning of its accidental spillage.</p><p>I recognize that life is short, and that there is still so much work to be done. Software engineering is where and how I have chosen to do it.</p>"
